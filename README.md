To run the website on your computer:
</br>

## Install XAMPP: 
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

## To run:
</br>
Open XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL modules. 
Go to http://localhost/dashboard/ If you see the XAMPP header, then congrats, you're in! Note: MySQL and all the pretty web package will run as long as you keep these settings on XAMPP control panel. To turn off these features, go back to XAMPP control panel and click "Stop" where applicable (MySQL and Apache), and the server will stop running. 
</br>
To access the Database (MySQL), click on phpMyAdmin. Click on MySQL and you will be able to enter SQL commands, such as create table, insert data, etc. to populate your local database (data coming soon :) )
